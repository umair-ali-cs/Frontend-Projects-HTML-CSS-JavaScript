# Spotify UI Clone

This project is a frontend recreation of a music streaming web interface inspired by Spotify. It is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript and focuses on dynamic UI rendering, layout design, and interactive components without using any external frameworks.

## Overview

The application reproduces a modern music browsing interface that displays songs, artists, albums, and categories in a structured layout. Content sections are generated dynamically using JavaScript, and user interactions such as hover effects, sliders, and section expansion are handled through DOM manipulation and event listeners.

The goal of this project was to practice building responsive layouts, structuring reusable UI components, and implementing interactivity using pure JavaScript.

## Features

Dynamic creation of content sections using JavaScript
Interactive sliders for browsing content
Hover animations and play button effects
Responsive layout behavior for different screen sizes
Reusable UI components for songs, artists, and categories
Structured separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
